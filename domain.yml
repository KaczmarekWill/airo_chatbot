	utter_connect_to_dormwifi:
	- text: To connect to the wireless network at the dorm area, you will need 3 main things! 1. A device that has an 802.11g or 802.11n wireless adapter (don't worry, any device that has a browser will have this), 2. the policy key, and 3. an antivirus software. Once you have those 3 things, you can click on UNF-Wireless and log in with your N-number and myWings password.
	utter_policy_key_info:
	- text: The policy key will check that anti-virus and anti-spyware programs are installed and up to date, and "automatic operating system updates" are enabled. If these services are not present, the computer will be quarantined and pointed to remediation web sites for updating. The policy key will also look to make sure the computer does not have Peer to Peer software/services running or a router connected. When policy key requirements are met, network access is allowed. After initial installation, if the policy key is deleted from the computer, it will need to be installed again before the computer has Internet access.
	utter_policy_key_install:
	- text: Once you have signed into UNF_Wireless, it should detect that you do not have a policy key installed and then prompt you to donwload and install it. If you are not being prompted to sign in and download the policy key, go to https://auth.impulse.com:8443 and sign in. If you run into any issues, please call the ITS Help Desk at (904) 620-4357 or bring your laptop to them at the first floor of the library.
